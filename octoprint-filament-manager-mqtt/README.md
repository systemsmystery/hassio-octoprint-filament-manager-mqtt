## Usage

When started, the add-on will create a sensor for each spool within the Octoprint Filament Manager. The sensor will report the following data:

* If the spool is currently set within filament manager (Active)
* The remaining filament for the spool (Remaining)
* The spool ID (Spool ID)
* The used amount of filament (Used)
* The initial weight of the spool (Weight)

Below is an example of what the sensor looks like within Home Assistant:

![Sensor example](./images/sensor.jpg)

In addition to each spool sensor, an additional sensor is created which supplies a drop down with each spool ID. This will update and reflect which spool is currently active.

**_Note:_** In a future version of this add-on, the ID selected from the dropdown will also be set as the active spool within filament manager.
